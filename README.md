Changes since SoilMod for FS2013
--------------------------------

A quick rundown of the SoilMod-FS15 changes compared to SoilMod-FS2013:

- Two foliage-layers; one full-size for 'visibles', one half-size for 'non-visible'
- Soil pH increased to use 4-bits, so lower level-change between steps
- Fertilizer concept changed to Nutritions N+PK
- Nutritions N+PK (4- & 3-bits) is affected by fertilizers and crop growth
- 3 fertilizer spray-types that increase; NPK, PK or N. Manure/slurry also adds N+PK.
- Soil moisture added (3 bits), which weather will affect (high temperature or rain)
- 3 extra herbicide spray-types that adds germination prevention (lasts 4 growth-cycles)
- Crop yield during harvest, will be affected by pH level, nutrition N+PK levels, soil moisture and weeds
- Two distinct types of weed, and their patches not so square
